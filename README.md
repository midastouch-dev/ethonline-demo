# ETHOnline Compound Protocol Workshop

This repository contains a very basic UI that uses the Compound Protocol. The app enables users to earn interest on their crypto assets by supplying them to the protocol. Users can also mark their supplied asset as collateral, borrow assets from the protocol, and see how much of an asset they can borrow with their current collateral.

The app currently supports ETH, USDC, and UNI. The app runs a Hardhat fork of Ethereum mainnet and seeds assets in the first account in the specified mnemonic.


## to run the app
npm install
npm start
```
